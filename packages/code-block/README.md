# `CodeBlock` react component

This is a wrapper around [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net) with a "toit
branded" theme, opinionated functionality and extensions.

The idea is that all projects at Toit use this package whenever code is being
displayed, so they all have a unified way of presenting code.
