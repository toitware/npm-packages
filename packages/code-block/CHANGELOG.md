# Changelog

## 0.1.1

- Switch to the default theme to prevent legibility issues. We'll probably want
  to switch to another one later, but for now this is a safe bet.

## 0.1.0

- Switch to the `use-codemirror` package for SSR support.

## 0.0.1

- Copied the `CodeBlock` that was in the libs documentation.
- Add a `removeExcessWhitespace` function to make it easier to work with mdx
  files.
